## ðŸ“£ Information

The complete website, every single component that is uses, was developed & coded by me. The styling was inspired by many resources available on the internet but was not copied (art of converting UI/UX designs to css :p).

Although this is not a gatsby starter theme, I am making it available for use. If you are using this website/parts of this website for personal use, please don't claim it as your own. Also, attribution will be highly appreciated.

PS: This website was built using gatsby's <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world">hello-world</a> starter.


## âš’ Installation

2. **Install the Gatsby CLI**

   ```sh
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   
3. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install

## ðŸš€ Building and Running

1.  **Generate a production build**

### OR

1.  **Build, Serve and Watch**
